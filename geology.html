            Geology of the White Walls Way
          </h2>
          <p>
            As you walk the Whitewalls Way from Malmesbury to Luckington you
            will be walking entirely on rocks of the middle Jurassic period,
            laid down around 160-165 million years ago. At this time, the
            underlying rock of what was to form the Malmesbury district was a
            lot further south than it is now - about 30&deg;N, roughly the latitude
            the Canary Islands are today. It was part way through a long erratic
            journey north from near the South Pole, where it had been 330
            million years earlier, borne by moving tectonic plates – a journey
            that continues today. The seas were warm with strong currents –
            similar to the modern Bahamas. This environment gives rise to
            ooliths, which are tiny egg-shaped bodies formed by precipitation of
            lime (calcium carbonate) on a minute nucleus of sand. Deposition of
            these in the sea, and compression by sediments deposited on top, has
            given rise to the rock (oolitic limestone), which underlies most of
            the area. However, the sediments being deposited in the Jurassic
            seas varied quite a lot from this general picture, and as this
            affects both what you will see on the walk and what you feel under
            your boots, a little more detail is called for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sequence of rocks in the Whitewalls Way area is shown in the
            diagram below.

          <h3>Fuller's Earth</h3>
          <p>
            The deposition of oolitic limestone in the Jurassic was interrupted
            by volcanic episodes which deposited minerals which turned into a
            thick layer of clay – the Fuller’s Earth. All traces of the volcano
            have vanished, but it must have been reasonably close – possibly in
            the western approaches to the English Channel. The Fullers Earth is
            not seen on this walk, but it outcrops close to Malmesbury and has
            had an effect on the development of the woollen industry here and
            throughout the Cotswolds, since the clay has the property of
            absorbing the grease from sheep’s wool – and was used for this
            purpose in the process known as fulling. The development of
            Malmesbury as a town thus owes something to this ancient volcano.
          </p>
          <h3>Great Oolite and Forest Marble</h3>
          <p>
            Once the volcanic episode was over, oolitic limestones continued to
            be deposited in our area and these are divided into two fairly
            distinct layers, known as the Great Oolite and the Forest Marble.
            The Great Oolite can be seen near Luckington and is an excellent
            building stone – the formation provided the stone for building much
            of Bath and the older Oxford colleges. The underlying rock for most
            of the walk is however the Forest Marble, and it is this that
            provided the building stone for most of the local villages. It is
            not strictly speaking a marble, but rather a hard limestone – it is
            named after Charnwood Forest in Oxfordshire where it was once used
            for making ornamental fireplaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seas in which the Great Oolite and Forest Marble were deposited
            were inhabited by a variety of creatures, largely shellfish, and you
            can see some of these preserved as fossils. The most common fossil
            remains are shell debris, the remains of long-ago beaches and
            sandbanks. There were larger creatures in the seas of the time, but
            they stayed further out to sea where there was more to eat – hence
            their remains are not found here. On the adjacent land masses the
            dinosaurs held sway, including Megalosaurus, the first dinosaur to
            be named, whose remains have been found in rocks of the same age
            near Oxford. The first birds (now the only surviving relatives of
            the dinosaurs) were beginning to take to the air. The vegetation
            would have looked odd to our eyes – there were no flowering plants
            then, but there were swampy forests of such plants as conifers,
            cycads and the maidenhair fern tree Ginkgo. A specimen of this
            “living fossil” species, apparently unchanged since the Jurassic, is
            planted outside Sherston Post Office – a living link to the time
            when its ancestral relatives grew on the islands round about the
            present site of Sherston.
          </p>
          <h3>Cornbrash</h3>
          <p>
            As the sea level began to rise in Jurassic times, the Forest Marble
            was succeeded by a very distinctive limestone called the Cornbrash
            which occurs widely over the Cotswolds. The Cornbrash has properties
            which made it suitable for growing corn in the days before modern
            agricultural machinery – as opposed to most of the Cotswolds which
            was sheep country. The relatively weak limestone had eroded into
            small pieces which did not impede the plough (“brash”) and there was
            enough clay to hold nutrients and water, but not so much as to
            promote waterlogging. The Cornbrash also provided a firm substrate
            for building – central Malmesbury is built on Cornbrash.
          </p>
          <h3>Kellaways Clay</h3>
          <p>
            After the Cornbrash was deposited, the environment continued to
            change. Sea level rose further in our area, and although land was
            further away it started to have a greater influence, depositing
            organic-rich clays derived from the terrestrial environment. The
            first of these clay formations is the Kellaways Clay, and you will
            meet this as you walk out of and in to Malmesbury. Clay deposition
            went on throughout the Upper Jurassic for the next 10-15 million
            years, forming the Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays which are such a
            feature of the land to the east. These clays may have been deposited
            in the Malmesbury area also, as was a thick layer of chalk in the
            succeeding Cretaceous Period. All this has gone: eroded away in the
            succeeding 60 million years of the Tertiary Period when Britain once
            again rose above the sea.
          </p>
          <h3>Naming of rocks</h3>
          <p>
            Incidentally, the names of these rocks were given in the late
            eighteenth century by William Smith, who is generally credited with
            making the World’s first national geological map and who started his
            researches in the Bath area. These are thus some of the World’s
            first geological names.
          </p>
          <h3>The Cotswold dip-slope</h3>
          <p>
            The local rocks are not just a horizontal layer-cake. A legacy of
            the Tertiary Period is the approximately 3 NW-SE slope of the area,
            characteristic of the Cotswold dip slope. This slope reflects the
            slope of the underlying rocks, which were horizontal when laid down,
            and have therefore been tilted upwards by some massive force. This
            may have been caused by the uplift of the Alps far to the south,
            which was caused in turn by the collision of two tectonic plates.
            Because erosion has been faster on the higher parts of the
            Cotswolds, the younger rocks have eroded off more than round
            Malmesbury. The effect is thus that, when walking from Malmesbury to
            Luckington, you are walking back in geological time, as shown in
            Figure 2. The steep slope on the right of the diagram is the valley
            cut by the River Avon.

          </figure>
          <h3>Ice-age valleys</h3>
          <p>
            A striking feature of the area is the trench-like valleys which hold
            the River Avon and its tributaries. The modern river is not large
            enough to have cut them – almost certainly they largely date from
            the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago. This lasted
            about 100,000 years, and a large icecap accumulated over most of
            Britain. Though the main icecap did not quite reach the Malmesbury
            area, the landscape would have been tundra-like, with accumulations
            of ice and snow on higher ground. We now know that at the end of the
            Ice Age the temperature rose remarkably quickly and this would have
            generated large volumes of meltwater, roaring down the existing
            valleys and excavating them close to their present depth. These
            events would have made the recent floods look rather pathetic. The
            excavated material was deposited on the plains beyond Malmesbury, or
            swept out to sea. Another legacy of this time is a range of
            superficial deposits on higher ground, probably from flowing
            meltwater, which are sometimes enough to change the properties of
            the soil which develops. Figure 3 shows a simplified geological map
            of the area. Note that there is a small area of Great Oolite in the
            valley between Sherston and Luckington. This is the “Sherston
            Inlier”- in which the Great Oolite appears at higher elevation than
            would be expected from the surrounding geology, for as yet
            unexplained reasons.
          </p>
          <h3>Reduced gravity</h3>
          <p>
            If you feel a spring in step as you walk through Malmesbury, it
            could be because you weigh a little less than you do (say) on the
            plain near the Bristol Channel. Because Malmesbury is underlain by
            some relatively light rocks, the force of gravity is not quite so
            strong there as it is in places underlain by denser rocks. The
            effect is not large, though it is easily measurable by scientific
            instruments. If you weigh exactly 13 stone in Chipping Sodbury, you
            will weigh only 12 stone, 13lb and 15.974oz in Malmesbury. Or if you
            prefer metric units, if you weigh exactly 80 kg in Chipping Sodbury,
            you will weigh 79.999 kg in Malmesbury. The bad news is that by
            walking up to Luckington, you will put on 4 thousandths of an ounce.
            This extra weight will be dwarfed by that of the mud clinging to
            your boots!

            Measurements of the force of gravity are performed to try to infer
            what is underground without the expense of drilling boreholes.
            Another form of survey is the aeromagnetic survey, in which tiny
            variations in the Earth’s magnetic field are recorded from an
            aircraft. In our area, this revealed that about 10,000 feet below
            the surface between Sherston and Tetbury, there is a large body
            (several miles across) with magnetic properties. Although it is not
            known for certain what it is, its characteristics lead geologists to
            believe that it is the same rock as forms the Malvern Hills to the
            North. This is the oldest rock in southern England, dating to the
            late Precambrian period 660-680 million years ago.
